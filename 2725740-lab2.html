      <h3>Latest project     </h3>
      <p> I developed a comprehensive student management system in Delphi, integrating SQL for database management and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and scalability. The system was designed for Grade 9 students to input their academic grades, after which it analyzed their performance and provided subject recommendations for Grade 10 based on predefined criteria. The application featured a structured database to store student records, grades, and subject choices while allowing teachers to oversee and manage student progress. Additionally, the system included functionalities for fee payments, enabling students and parents to track outstanding balances and make payments through the platform. A dedicated teacher administration module allowed educators to update student records, monitor academic performance, and generate reports. By combining Delphi’s robust UI capabilities with SQL’s efficient data handling, the system provided a seamless and user-friendly experience for students, teachers, and administrators.  </p>
